                    <h1>3x3 Durrës</h1> <br>
                    <p>3x3 Durrës is one of the first 3-on-3 basketball events organised
                        in this city. Approved by FIBA3x3 and FIBA's program FIBA Time-Out 2.0
                        it provides a "battlefield" for the basketball gladiators
                        from Albania, Kosovo and other countries. Our aim is offering the best that the city has to
                        offer including the sea, the promenade and high-quality basketball; 
                        Promoting the newest Olympic Sport to the young generation; Bringing
                        something new to the table for tourist attraction. <br>The tournament 
                        puts twelve teams against each-other in four groups of three teams. The top two
                        teams in the group are qualified for the next stage, The Quarterfinals. 
                        After this stage come the Semifinals where four teams clash
                        against each-other to reach the Finals where the winner takes the prize.
                        There are also two other competitions organized: The 3-point challenge and
                        The Slam-Dunk challenge.

                        <p style="width: 30ch; text-align: center;">3x3 basketball is not like the game of basketball you
                        are used to. It's like a totally different sport.
                        If you want to learn more about the rules and how it's
                        played, <a target="blank" href="https://fiba3x3.com/en/rules.html"><b>click here!</b></a></p>

                        <p style="text-align: center; width: 40ch;">The game ball used in 3x3 is unorthodox too. It's made of 
                            material and design that helps the player have a better grip
                            of the ball. For more info on the ball <a target="blank" href="https://fiba3x3.com/en/ball.html"><b>click here!</b></a>
